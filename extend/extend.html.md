Here are all the different ways that DocPad can be extended.

## Module
DocPad can also be used as a module in other systems
- [You can discover the API accessible to your here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/API)

## Configuration Files
Configuration files allow you to apply site specific extensions and configurations
- [You can discover how use the configuration files here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Configuration)
- [You can discover the events available to you here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Events)

## Plugins
Plugins provide extra functionality to DocPad, and can be re-used across Skeletons
- [You can discover existing plugins here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Plugins)
- [You can learn to write plugins here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Writing-a-Plugin)
- [You can discover the events available to you here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Events)

## Skeletons
Skeletons are essentially re-usable websites/projects/webapps that you've created with DocPad
- [You can discover existing skeletons here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/Skeletons)
- To get your Skeleton during the bootstrap process of DocPad, post an issue on the [docpad-extras](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras) [issue tracker](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras/issues)

## Future
In the future, DocPad will also gain [support for themes](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/126) which can be used to change the look and feel of particular skeletons.
